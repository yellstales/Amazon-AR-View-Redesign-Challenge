# Amazon-AR-View-Redesign-Challenge
AR Design Challenge for Introduction to AR/VR course at University of Michigan

# Overview
Amazon AR view is a feature that allows the users to preview the object in the Amazon shop in the user's own space. 

This redesign was done as part of Introduction to AR/VR course at the University of Michigan. The goal of the assignment was to redesign 2-3 existing interactions in the Amazon AR view based on the course material. 

# Process
I focused my efforts on redesinging object movement and rotations. 

As part of the process, I produced lo-fi paper and physical prototype:

This Unity project represents the hi-fi digital prototype of the redesign.
